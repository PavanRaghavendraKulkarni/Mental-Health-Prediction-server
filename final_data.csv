0,i want to be able to melt into someones arms and know im fully loved and that they have my back i want a support system i want to feel like theres a point to my life i want to be able to relax and breathe im so tired
1,might sound messed up but at least id lose weight and be pretty for once but instead i keep stuffing my face with fast and sugary foods to feel happy for at least few seconds  where did my discipline go
2,youre young go workout why arent you just happy i dont know i really dont know  and no right now i dont feel like working out sir i can barely shower and you expect me to workout
3,i missed out on every important learning experience of youth because i chose to give into my anxiety isolate myself and take the path of least resistance even a life of constant mistakes would be better than this because at least one can learn from mistakes instead ive done nothing and learned nothing with every passing year ive missed more important milestones compared to my peers and it shows every time i have to interact with another person
4,i wish i could give my life to someone more deserving someone whos dying because of cancer or or just anything that would make their life short i wish i could give it to someone who wants to live
5,pretty much my title i feel like ending my life pretty much nonstop and have been feeling that for a good couple years now however i know i will never do it because of my family i could never do that to them so in a twisted way im not suicidal at all as i know i would never go through with it idk im just curious if anyone else kind of feel like they are only alive to keep others happy
6,hey everyone i just realised loneliness kills a person way faster than anything else  i have been so lonely that im becoming delusional been talking to myself lately seeing people happy is kills my souland mind  everyone around me looks so damm happy to me and i just couldnt think to ask myself how can they be so dam happy why cant i be just like that and forgive myself and move on in life i feel like killing myself is the only option to end my pain and to put me out of misery fuck it hurts when you just lay and stare at the celeing and think about the mistakes i did that brought me into this state of mind where i dont find a escape  the only mistake one can do is having a pure heart in this world
7,like my life just feels so fucking empty i dont want to be here and i dont have the guts for suicide so im just going through the motions waiting for some disease or infection to kill me
8,does anybody else feel like youre just living day by day and you dont have any goals in mind  like there are times that you picture yourself doing something good that you would love to succeed in but then there is that voice in your head that tells you that youre dumb and that will never be able to accomplish it and then you hate yourself for thinking so damn negative and no matter how hard you try to be positive you just cant so you go back to laying in bed all damn day and not do shit and then it just keeps repeating every single day you see all your friends being happy online traveling graduating accomplishing their goals and you feel like complete shit for not being like them
9,im tired im lost i just want this pain and numbness to end
10,hey guys i dont really have anyone to talk to about this so i was in at a burger place last night and while i was waiting for my order one of the workers came up and asked me if i was okay i just hit a pretty hard leg workout so i assumed that i looked tired or something i told her i was alright and she asked if id like a free fountain drink i declined and thanked her a few minutes later she came out with my order gave it to me and with a concerned look on her face said  seriously are you okay  i felt like i wanted to cry no one ever asks me that not even people close to me and when i try to talk about it with people close to me its a lot of bullshit ive even lost some friendships from opening up to people im very guarded at this point i told her i was alright and to have a good night i guess ive been holding a lot of shit in because i started fucking balling when i got in my car i wanna go back and hug her because that seriously meant so much i felt totally fine walking into that burger place but i guess i didnt look look like it ive been to therapists and what not but none have been any help i really dont know whats wrong with me all i know is that im not alright edit wowow thank you so much for the kind words everyone im blown away by how many of you have responded im going to try my best to respond to everybody but if i dont just know that i am incredibly thankful it means a lot ive decided im going to go back and thank her
11,seriously you wake up you force yourself to do whatever hygienic rituals you need to do before actually getting on with your day maybe that burns thirty minutes to an hour topsand for pretty much everyone over the age of 10 that usually becomes a rushed ritual where you feel you never actually have enough time and are trying to make whatever bullshit you have laid out in front of you so on to that bullshit in front of you you go to school or work something forced upon your will that you cant decline doing as its something that simply needs to be done in pretty much every form of society known to modern man on this planet you get through whatever horse shit you need to and then what you perhaps engage in trivial relationships that dont last or give you the false hope of something meaningful in your life maybe you have sex which is a fleeting pleasure before its over and you are thrust back into the usual rhythm of your life maybe you have some hobbies you take part in that dont actually mean anything beyond the false belief that they hold some form of value rather than picking things to waste away time that you wouldnt be spending doing nothing just ticking down the seconds your life is wasting away maybe you take part in said hobbies to attract partners to have said relationships and sex with in some diminutive roundabout effort to tie together any meaning at all to the worthless time wasting shit you might take part in that you believe acts as an identity to your existence the people you wish to attract have even less substance believing just because youre a shmuck doing some bullshit all of a sudden they take an interest in you and decide to give you a shot at engaging in a morethanaverage interaction just what the fuck is even the point its all so fucking stupid shallow and meaningless if life isnt meant to be analyzed so deeply and just enjoying the ride what is there to even enjoy getting lost in the transparency of it all turning a blind eye to the nothingness of the average day filling your schedule with aloof activities that are brainless and not meaningful in any way shape or form just for the sake of filling time before old age and death fuck it just makes no sense to me how any of that can make people happy it just comes off as people tricking themselves that what theyre doing is meaningful in any way and then when people such as myself voice this they say im just a doubter im just negative or ive got issues i should see a therapist if only i could see the forest for the trees or people feel bad for me that im missing out on life having such pessimistic views i just fucking hate life i want to tell everyone about it too i wish for those who claim to have found happiness to tell me why they think their life is actually worth living
12,like theyre genuinely happy or even sad or whatever else but theyre not depressed how come they want to wake up the next day dont feel dreadful when they wake up i dont even remember the time when i wasnt depressed im only happy when i sleep because im not conscious of anything
13,i cant make a list of everything thats wrong with my life its just pretty much everything i cant even sleep anymore im living in constant despair every time something good happens something awful happens shortly after literally every single fucking time on top of this nobody gives a flying fuck literally nobody at all instead of receiving any support from people im mocked or told its not that bad even if they have no fucking idea of what the fuck im dealing with i cant live anymore like this i literally cant this can hardly be called living and things are only getting worse im on the verge of killing myself and nobodys giving me a fucking hand and a call to a suicide hotline wont do shit and for the love of god if youre gonna reply dont come to me with pointless positivism the last thing i need is feeling any more mocked than what i feel right now
14,for example ill want to play a video game but for some reason its really difficult to bring myself to do so ill often end up procrastinating it by scrolling mindlessly on my phone all day who else feels this way
15,i cant bear  being alive anymore im so isolated its become funny again
16,idk i remember since i was a kid every time i cried i was scolded or lightly beaten every time i was sad i was called names and was berated because i ruined my families mood i was sad a lot lol i was suicidal when i was 13 and actively planned on killing myself when i was 15 my uncle killed himself a little before i could and just the memory of the funeral and the subsequent sorrow my mom experienced was enough for me to not consider suicide viable for 8 years i remember getting really drunk at 16 and when my mom scolded me were you really that bored that you had to get that drunk i idiotically blurted out yeah bored of life and then went on a tangent about how i was really apathetic of everything and alluded to suicidal thoughts in the morning she just told me how could you do and say that to me after all ive been through she was legit mad at me for a week lol i still live with them at 23 and last night my sister was kinda bummed out and while consoling her my mom said its normal to feel sad and casually mentioned how im always happy and upbeat as a compliment i guess havent felt happy in ages and every time ive shown sadness i was labeled as a wanker guess im a great actor at least
17,i was really depressed over quarantine in 2020 and i tried to tell my best friend about it who i was best man for in his wedding that october and it totally changed the dynamic of the friendship he stopped responding to messages and doesnt talk to me anymore  so now i kinda feel like ill never open up to anyone i know again edit i have been overwhelmed in a good way by the amount of support this community has given me in these comments i am reading each one i very much appreciate all the time you put into these comments and suggestions 
18,i need to get this off my chest ive been crying for hours straight im now completely unable to speak lets start off i have dark skin i live in sweden and im starting to become sick of racism yes it might be funny to joke about but in reality it really hurts for me at least im sick of being viewed as ugly weird and worthless the boys in my class continuously tried to make me say different slurs ive done everything to look pretty i know it doesnt matter but i do anything to just be accepted and respected ive starved myself for days even though im an average weight ive tried to talk more but every time i say a single word they give me the what the fuck look i hate myself so much and i wanna die so badly i dont know what im doing wrong please just accept me please just be nice to me at least i just want to be loved update thanks so much for all the love and support it really warms my heart to see that people actually care these comments gives me motivation to keep going and try to stand up for myself im a pretty young teenager and dont know much about how to use this app im very thankful for the support though theres only a few days left until summer break which im very exited about ill be going to a new school after that and i really hope people will be kind there im sorry for not answering all the comments but im very touched by every single one hope youll have a good day
19,i simply dont have the passion or mental capacity to be good at anything no matter how hard i try i know i dont have to do that in order to live but its disheartening to always see people talking about their skills when i have absolutely nothing to show myself
20,lately ive been feeling like trash worthless lonely honestly im desperate for someone to talk to and ive tried talking to my familyfriends and they just seem to not care i was avoiding telling my boyfriend because i feel like a burden and although he has told me to come to him whenever i feel down i just cant bring myself to talk to him i feel guilty for taking too much of his time hes always with me at uni so i didnt want to take his alone time yesterday he asked me if i wanted to sleepover so i did but i still didnt tell him anything today i broke down while we were arguing and he told me to leave i was really hurt and because i was desperate to spend time with someone i told him what was going on he told me i could stay but he was going out at that time i asked him for a hug and he came and gave me one and i thought that it was a good time to open up but he suddenly exploded and started screaming at me to shut up i wasnt going to argue anymore i just thought that because it was a vulnerable moment i could open up about my suicidal thoughts and how ive been feeling but he just assumed i was going to complain about him and told me to shut up unless i wanted him to break up with me he left and im waiting for him to come back because he told me i could talk when hes back i dont know if i should continue on relying on him his reaction really hurt me today btw its not that i dont want to seek for medical help ive been to a lot of specialists but i just havent had a good psychologist or psychiatrist that could really help me im currently under medication though
21,no matter how much therapy i get and how many stupid exercises i do to handle my emotions i think ill always be unhappy with myself and life i only exist to not upset my parents and the closest ones around me i try not to self harm just to make them feel okay even though i really want to most of the time sure ill laugh and have fun on occasion but that doesnt mean that i want to exist
22,how the hell is everyone affording these outrageous therapy prices going to be economically ruined if i try solving any of my problems with a professional
23,im extremly afraid of suicide because its a big part of my trauma im still not really coping with the guilt of my friend comitting suicide im extremly afraid that it happens again with someone i love even tough theres no one to be worried about at the moment but every time im in a depressive episode and my life feels hopeless and i tell my therapist about how alone and hopeless i feel she asks me if i have suicidal thoughts i think she has to ask this but it just freaks me out so hard that i just say no without asking what suicidal thoughts contain im so afraid of the word i guess that i dont have the courage to tell her that it freaks me out
24,thats all i gotta say goodnight edit i forgot to say i was contemplating suicide on the bridge aight bye update i just woke up but thank you all very much for your support im feeling better now after i read the comments  and for anyone wondering what made me do that last night i was sleep deprived overwhelmed with fear and then had a meltdown that nearly hurt my family so i needed to get out before i actually hurt them dont worry i apologized and were all good now 
25,i have accomplished nothing of substance at my current age people are graduating and having some relationships while i am basically startingr from scratch ive been in therapy for a couple of months and im still not seeing much improvement i dont have a job and dont know what to study i dont have a girlfriend and dont know how to socialize i still live with parents i dont think i have many positive qualities at all any advie
26,i 22f am so tired of people saying that i have so much infront of me and how wonderful life is yeah there might be good things ahead of me but guess what i dont want it i just want to go to sleep and not wake up i have no idea what its like to be really happy i have no idea what its like to live one day without anxiety i have no idea what its like to not be depressed for longer than few weeks i have no idea what its been like to live a carefree childhood i have no idea what wanting to live feels like i have no idea what its like to not have excruciating pain inside of you i hav eno idea what its like to really trust people i dont know what its like to not have suicide plans figured out i have no idea what its like to let people see the worst of you i have no idea what its like to not be sick i just needed to rant about all of this to someone so if you read it completely thank you
27,what is it with everybody asking me if id like to go for a walk as if that would somehow cure my depression always go for a walk as if it isnt a physically and mentally exhausting sensory overload of loud cars swishing by sun wind and sweat and to top it all off a person talking next to me where i have to answer their stupid questions with a contrived yes or mhm or maybe a fake laughter every now and then a walk is the furthest thing from a cure at least to me it is torture i know that they mean well but i explained to them many times why i dont wanna go for a walk but its as if they just forget what i said
28,i feel so horrible for this but sometimes when im really struggling i just wish someone i love died or something so that i would have a reason for being in so much pain it seems like it would be easier to have a reason to be hurting this much im an awful person
29,instead theyre the fucking worst i have no friends no partner and i barely leave my room my grades are failing and i suck at everything involved with school im the definition of a loser i should be out doing something right now like being at mall painting with my friends or skating but apparently not im too much of a loner its so embarrassing and isolating i feel like im wasting time
30,a few weeks ago i made a post stating i would kill myself if i lost my job i then proceeded to get fired i was planning on ending it but instead i had a complete mental breakdown spent almost a grand on camping supplies left my family a note then drove so far north that the highways ran out and the nearest excuse for civilization was almost 300kms away all with the vague idea of either surviving as a hermit or dying in the woods with my cat i thought it was all pointless and that i was never going to amount to anything and that i was better off either dead or gone to be honest i still sort of feel that way i was up there all alone ready to start my life as a nomad i had built myself a camp and never had any intention of seeing another human again when some rcmp officers found me they told me there were people looking for me and took my back to where my parents where waiting and i later found out that a ton of my friends and family had rallied together to find me had just dropped everything and spread all over northern saskatchewan and somehow had managed it i thought i had covered my tracks so well i left my phone at home and only ever used cash past that point but there some miracle they still found me im back at home with my parents now and getting the help i need im seeing a therapist and im on some new meds i guess the point of this post is just me trying to say that there are people that most likely care about you and that getting help is important i am deleting my reddit account this website is horrible and does nothing good for my or anyone elses mental state x200b i hope whoever reads this can get the help they need
31,i mean you have zero interest to do anything whatsoever i dont have the energy for anything my hobby which is art has become a chore im unemployed have zero friends whatsoever no goals or ambition only 22 but it feels like im 80 and lived out my life already
32,i dont want a future i just want to quit
33,like ive read so many times of people being scared of saying too much or being too honest to their therapistpsychiatrist like whats the point i struggle with suicidal thoughts a lot but id never dare to seek help because from what ive heard they just drug you up and keep you in some hospital like thatd be so much fucking worse i feel like they dont wanna help us they just want us to shut up and dont make things inconvenient for the functional people
34,im currently having my last meal ive decided that today is my last day on this world im eating kfc and honestly im in peace with myself the only reason i am writing here is because no one else cares i wish you all the best
35,i have never driven outside of my state and i want to see how far i can go just because im tired of my own little world i want to prove to myself that i can get out i want to feel alive again i would love to see the beach and im fine with digging into my savings even though thats not exactly wise use of it i dont really care anymore does that sound crazy it seems better than just sitting in my room waiting for the time to pass i just want to show myself i can live again and i dont know how else to do it
36,i think i didnt realize how much of my selfworth was tied to my achievements and productivity now that i cant bring myself to even do my hobbies or actively job hunt again i feel like a piece of garbage everyday not contributing anything to anyone the guilt and shame is eating me alive i received two more rejections yesterday and that was my breaking point had a pretty nasty breakdown in my room pure rage at myself i wish i could spontaneously die instead of having to go through the motions
37,can anyone else relate my job is somewhat fun but its extremely stressful im barely coping and often find myself drinking alcohol after work to calm down i often get nightmares and wake up covered in sweat being unemployed makes me feel totally worthless but theres also a weird sense of peace and comfort in just sitting at home playing on the internet for 14 hours a day i guess being employed is slightly better than being unemployed but ugh both options suck
38,im tired to hope that someone will come and just save me from this fucking loneliness i feel like dying
39,the title was long but thats basically it i feel like im ready to get out there now but ive been this shell of a human for so long now clinically depressed and barely leaving the house i feel like i barely know who i am anymore tbh its a very dehumanizing feelingand makes finding the path forward that much harder because im just picking something just to pick something but i think i would rather pick a path that would bring me positivity put me around good people be something i could be passionate about and find purpose in for once rather than just taking whatever job i can get as a college dropout with my empty resume and save up money until i can move out ik its quite a luxury that im able to sit and ponder a decision like this and have parents who have been able to support me but if anyone has any experience similar to this have any advice about paths theyve found success in or just general things youd want to tell a person like me id love to hear it edit oh wow the day i made this post it didnt get much interaction so i just figured it went under the radar finally checked back again today and wow thanks for the responses ill respond to everyone individually too it sucks that so many of us can relate but also it makes me feel so much less alone and i appreciate all of you for that
40,im depressed as heck i thought maybe the weather getting nicer would help but nope i cant seem to get myself to go outside unless i absolutely have to and im just so tired all the time just so tired i sleep a lot too i sleep at least 10 hours if i dont work but after ive bee up for couple hours i need couple hours of nap just to function how am i supposed to live like this
41,i tried killing myself last night cried for about 1020 minutes or so then i spent a few hours trying to get the right knot on the noose lol then i gave up and just decided to tie the rope with a triple loop instead i hung it on my door knob since i couldnt do it from the ceiling i wrote a note too honestly nothing was going on in my head at the time i guess i kinda cleared everything out from crying it didnt really feel any different as i put my head in nothing emotional really as i let my body go loose i felt the blood rush up to my head before i knew it my body just went on autopilot as i took my head out and began coughing spit gasping for air and such i got rid of some tonsil stones from coughing so i guess its not too bad as im writing this i can still feel the rope around my neck my heart feels tight for some reason my legs felt kinda weak too everything is still gray hopeless theres no revelation or new meaning of life i cant even kill myself properly im so fucking useless lol i have some alcohol in the fridge so maybe ill try again when im drunk maybe edit my head kinda hurts maybe its because of the lack of oxygen in my head from the whole hanging thing
42,i cant do anything right no matter what choice i make im damned if i do im damned if i dont whiskey for dinner tonight
43,i can no longer handle the trauma of seeing my dad go from being so healthy to on a ventilator for over a month i am not myself im broken theres no life left i breakdown in isolation every day non stop i want to attempt to leave this life
44,i went through a brutal divorce in 2020 when my ex husband abruptly left for another woman and skipped town the divorce and subsequent custody battle cost a whopping 40000 in legal fees i am so deep in debt i honestly dont think i will ever be able to own a place of my own and will probably be renting permanently my mom also spent all her savings and dug herself into debt to help me and now she resents me i am emotionally exhausted hungry angry and i want to scream i feel like theres a void inside that keeps getting bigger and bigger and swallowing me up one bit at a time nothing gets better nothing is ever going to get better the only time i dont feel miserable is when i am sleeping if i wasnt a mother i would have already killed myself i dont want to feel so bad anymore but its like my brain has literally forgotten how to get enjoyment out of anything everything feels tantamount to tasteless food
45,what is there to be happy about im so tired of living theres nothing i want to do i have no motivation or ambition left for life
46,i 22f would love to live in a 2 bedroom apartment overviewing a city but i will never be able to finish college get a job and go to that job 5 times a week i would love to travel never gonna happen because no job no money i would love to get proper friends but i am so terrible with people and will push everyone away if they get too close  i feel so fucking unlikeble its ridicilous i was able to have a boyfriend couple years ago but now cuddling love touching sex makes me just anxious and i dont wanna go near any of that its gonna be another summer just me and my dog wasting all my money to weed bored and longing for a different life i think ive given up not gonna kms anytime soon but im just being im so tired its so fucking stupid why am i even typing this out i think i just wanna see if anyone else is struggling with  the same kind of thing or maybe i just wanted to say it out loud i dont know
47,i read an article about this claim a quick google search revealed a peer reviewed publication in nature magazine nature is a prestigious magazine how come such finding did not make headline news below you can find links to the article and the publication httpswwwwthrcomarticlenewslocaliuresearchersdevelopbloodtestfordepressionbipolardisorderteamneurosciencepsychiatry531de1466bcef794ab2bd928fa55c68f5b6 httpswwwnaturecomarticless4138002101061w
