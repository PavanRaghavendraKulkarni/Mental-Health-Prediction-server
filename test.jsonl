{"text": "tw panic attacks school failure mention of suicidal thoughts im a 15 year old autistic male as of the last year ive had to move to a behavioral school because of the extreme and borderline erratic panic attack i would have when confronted with anything associated with school the night before my first day at the behavioral school i told my mom i felt like i couldnt go and she said i needed to i kept begging and begging and it spiraled out of control from screaming no as loud as i could and plugging my ears to having a seizure like panic attack where i would run away from my stepdad who tried to get me out of the room while id scream and cry my eyes out endlessly it got to the point where my mom almost called the police because i wouldnt stop hitting myself and screaming for help thankfully that didnt happen because my mom called my dad and probably out of fear of worrying him i tried my best to stop crying which eventually lead to me calming down i know this sounds like stereotypical autistic breakdowns but something like this hasnt happened before at least not to the extent of this prior to this i couldnt even touch a computer because id start crying and even pulling up next to a school with full knowledge i wouldnt have to go in would make me beg my mom to get me away it even escalated to the point where because me and my mom had set a goal of 10 minutes next to the school and i couldnt take it i jumped out of the car and ran home as fast as i could which thankfully wasnt too far but you still had to cross several crossroads and even a train track which i didnt stop for most very long i eventually did go to the behavioral school where they allowed me to draw in class all day and didnt assign me any homework nor grade me but somedays id just feel so overwhelmed id have to go home for the day my mom and i chalked up my reaction to school as fear of academic pressure so we thought i was fine here however once we had break i found myself terrified to return again ive only started attending again as of 4 days ago in group therapy i talked about my experience with school and my fear of it and my therapist said it reminded her of some kind of ptsd reaction and when i honestly think about it im a bit mixed on it on one hand i could just be over reacting as ive always been a sensitive kid but i also never received accommodations for my disabilities i had so much trouble turning in work and succeeding in even easy tasks my mom would tell me that its easy work and she doesnt understand why i cant do the work and shed get into screaming matches with me over me not being able to do my homework i felt so humiliated at school everyone else was able to hit the bottom bar but ive never been able to hit it ever elementary and middle school was filled with fs and ds and great potential needs focus and every time i saw it id get sick i felt like my teachers were telling me to mine through a cave with my bare hands my teachers barely gave me any help at most theyd let me turn in work later i watched all my friends go to parties for kids who didnt get fs and i never went to a single one i was always told high school would be harder for me and id need to step up my game i think once covid hit it came to a complete low point it was my freshman year i couldnt turn in the most simple work one of which was turning in a drawing and i literally love drawing everyone else said it was easy work because they could look up the answers but doing homework would take up so much of my time that i wouldnt be able to turn in 2 or more assignments because i completed them after 1159 you honestly dont understand the psychological warfare the school system puts their low achieving students through until youre at the very bottom ive felt so inferior to my classmates and without my friends to look forward to after classes id lose my shit i felt like i was being forced to paint picassos paintings with crayon if i wanted to keep my god damn house all those fucking things i was barred off from and everything ive looked into ptsd and i honestly see so many traits i align with minus the nightmares ive found myself pretending to be a literal fictional character to get through the day literally drinking my fish tank water to get sick which is blatantly self destructive ridiculous insomnia that ruins my sleep schedule every 4 days and lasts for 2 weeks a lack of trust in my teachers and strangers depression and ever since elementary ive had somewhat abstract suicidal thoughts thats come to a peak in the last month thankfully that peak is pretty minor and my mom finally knows but i dont know what to do i want help i honestly do and if i get a ptsd diagnosis im praying this will help but at the same time is it possible to get ptsd from school i feel so alone right now in the experience and i honest to god need to know if anyone else has the same experience because im hitting a low and i cant get back up unless i know for certain tldr i think i have ptsd from failing schoolwork is that possible if it is and there are any survivors who has trauma from failing academics could you please share

after i started vaping cannabis again avoiding another psychosis risk by not smoking it etc i am just so incredibly lonely that i feel the need to write here im always alone throughout the years ive discovered that i seem to carry h1n1 forward in a heavy way as i picked it up from one of the first cases people have died around me in patterns for years and to go into explaining why i know this would be a tediously long process so not being believed or having anyone relate to me as well as needing to avoid worsening covid19 mutations means im always alone the last time i agreed to sit down with a friend for a coffee he died soon after from a heart attack my ex died after he got an infection from me my crush friend died after talking to me on the street my grandmother died of diagnosed h1n1 after i visited lets just say it has taken a long time to figure out what was going on my gp retired and like the new one neither of them understand or are biologically literate it seems talking to a therapist while in physical pain and not using cannabis for a couple of years only let me discuss my physical pain because it was so bad again i do feel better now but i do still have a lot of physical problems i dont work because i cant trust myself to show up what with sudden fatigue problems being a thing migraines too and i cant trust myself not to carry to others i cant even begin to explain how i feel i do feel suicidal often but i have no desire to end my life as i would only hurt those who would care albeit the same people family i dont really see anymore my body longs for a hug whilst feeling sickened by it my heart and mind long to feel understood at least on some level but people dont know me now i have been removed from social life for years ampx200b im actually glad that i stopped caring so much about how we are collectively destroying the planet recently i learned that no one else had gone as crazy as me about it in that i was always picking up rubbish from the ground walk everywhere live in poverty and talk online to myself really trying to change things in a positive way where i can but everyone else is in a different place it seems creating families going out with friends working ampx200b i know im doing what i have to do but i feel as if my lot in life has been seriously unfair it gets a lot worse this is really only the surface of the iceberg so to speak ampx200b is it crazy that i hurt so much when im lucky enough to not be dead or in as much physical pain as before do i really need to care that i have no one i can talk to and no one to meet anymore do i need to care that i am stuck in a number of ways im never able to shake the feeling that i and people in my family deserve better but that because life has denied it we must choose an emotion from an array of negative emotions to be realistic about life we have suffered abuse too seriously crazy corruptions i dont know what else to say i just thought id reach out here i just wish i could have a birthday party with people to go to it or receive a valentines card for once ive had a shit time its laughable i guess im also worried that ill turn into a misanthrope seeing as apathy towards human matters bothers me so much i go out of my way to help others safely while others seem to be very different almost as if im convinced that others are too selfish to be kind and shamelessly manipulative thieving narcissistic etc there are reasons i think this way but i wont go into it because that involves saying too much im always in shock with heart pain and depressed but trying to keep my smile within brains reach behind an actual mask usually from a young age i thought if i worked hard enough i could make my own fair luck but nothing could have been further from the truth everything has been insane those who have used and abused me drive past without a bother and i dont want to explain here what each of them did to me i try not to faint on the pavement from fatigue while they drive past a different class of individuals altogether in my mind i can barely breathe anymore and my heart feels like it will stop on its own soon the chest pain i got last week was scary i live alone so calling an ambulance would be difficult i just wanted to vent here hope that is a good idea im not ready to go i just need to fix my physiological emotionality i think and i really need to stop using coffee and alcohol to manage pain cannabis doesnt seem to do as much for me now either it just triggers a cascade that doesnt necessarilly go anywhere anymore i need to undo musculoskeletal damage from walking everywhere to get by in pain my cat relies on me if i end up in hospital there will be no one to take care of her and yet i had wanted to take care of family but that has been made impossible by their mental health gaslighting their and my life too ampx200b ill probably delete this soon im not sure what i expect from reaching out here i had a couple of partial psychoses after h1n1 attacked my spine ten years ago that lonely place where only spirits talk to you is pending again i wanted real humans not voices from spirits and i certainly cant take

{"text": " im so fking tired of everything im trying to move on and heal from everything that happened in my past but my family is the reason why i keep on getting to the same point ive had ibs since i was 14 my life was pretty fked up yk how it feels to have ibs in school i lost so many friends bcuz of it my point is that my parents keeps calling me lazy without understanding how hard to live with this chronic disease 4 years when i was 16 my parents wanted me to get into a medical good college so they wont need to pay for it if i get great grades then they wont have to pay just like they paid for my other siblings who failed to get in it they made me take classes before last year which means i had to go to school for 11th grade and take lessons with 12th grades imagine having ibs and going out for like 12 hours i was also bullied in that time bcuz of ibs i was mentally and physically tired i pushed myself too much and ended up crying every night but waking up in the morning to continue my life at that time i thought to myself if my ibs wont disappear then whats the point in studying college will be more like a hell to me i convinced my parents to take me to the doctors while they kept on saying yk theres no cure and you have to live with it i had 3 colonoscopy from 3 diff doctors and they all gave me useless medicine i got kinda depressed knowing i wont be able to get my normal life back i became depressed and i didnt had any friend at that time even the ones i knew starts to ignore me so i left them be i started getting bad grades and didnt care about or thought about anything in that time it felt like i used all my energy the year before and it all doesnt matter anymore i failed in that year even tho i wanted to success but i couldnt whats the use of success if i cant even work ibs ruined my life my parents became more strict at that time my siblings shamed me for failing and talked about how their grades used to be back then i remember at that year i literally kept crying everyday for 4 months at least what hurts no matter how much i try to explain to them about ibs they just say yeah but everyone has it why you gotta over react those people who made it are they better than you we gave you everything and all we ask from you is to study it was literally so hard for me to not having a person there for me or understands me i felt like the whole world was against me then after that i took another year i studied a lot i kept on pushing so i can make it to the college they want me to get in and i actually i did it i made it even tho noun of my siblings did i continued a year cuz it was covid so i pass a year in college i was honestly so relived then this year they announce that we should take a 3 days and i went for a few days but couldnt continue cuz my i had to go to the bathroom every 5 mins and also i saw people from old school so i couldnt take it the bullying and the trauma theyll tell everyone about me and the worst part its not like im cured its still happening and i swear if i was cured i wouldnt give a damn about the old people in my school but the problem my suffering is still here i cant eat anything cuz it will trigger my stomach and even if i didnt eat my stomach would still be upset so i asked my parents that i want to take a gap year cuz fr if i kept on pushing myself and only listening to what my parents tells me imma go insane like i was back then tw i used to cut my thighs so i can feel smth cuz everything seemed so unreal back then its like i was meant to suffer i cried so much that my vision got bad rn and i literally stayed awake for almost months slept only for 3 hours a day so i couldnt make myself worse i needed that gap year and i took it no matter how much they tried to convince me that im making a wrong decision but i knew myself better and they wouldnt care less as long im successful so finally i started to care about myself this year and its been kinda good for healing on the other hand my brother is failing hes been in med school since 6 years and keeps failing and my parents keeps on paying for him until this day trying to convince him to study they keep on comparing me to him it makes me so mad like all what you out me thru and i actually made it into a college where u wont need to pay for it and my siblings all of them didnt make it as much as i did they werent ill and they hadnt a fking disease that mess up their life they had friends who supported them i wish i had only one person at least to comfort me at that time and tells me i did my best and theyre proud of me but i got no one in that time do you realize how hard its for me to stay alive while i got no purpose here i gave my parents and they still not proud keeps on making me feel like a failure its not like i dont want to be successful i really want it so bad i actually wish i had any of their normal life do you think i want to stay in house with no friends and no job its funny cuz my mom literally said to me youre lazy youve always been ur whole life so its not the ibs not ur suffering with this chronic disease its literally just you being lazy i know you ur whole life youve always wanted to just have fun and never go to school lol next 2 weeks after she said that i spent a whole month in the hospital bcuz of the pain and until today i actually wanted to heal and stay away from anything that ruin my mood but my anger issues couldnt take it when my lovely sister who should be supportive and understands me said you too will become like ur brother who failed whats the diff between u and him see how i made our parents proud she says it in front of my parents with a smile shes literally shaming me for smth i have no control over i told her that i dont want to hear her say that ever again and said are yall stupid or act like it how many times do u want me to explain this to u i dont want to hear you say that ever again then they took her side and im the bad guy rn for not controlling my anger man im sick of it theyll never realize how much i tried to make them proud and its never enough and it hurts that they all got an easy life they couldve done classes and jobs easier so why are they comparing me and idk whats wrong with my siblings they say they wanna help me but it seems all they do is talking about how theyre good at their jobs and how easily they passed college and im a failure who isnt like them i wanna kms tf i even hate god if theres one cuz its not fair why am i the only one who have to go thru this i literally believe that everyone hates me i think ill be alright in the morning but yeah i just wanted to vent and ik no one would understand having ibs except this place pls tell me i am not overreacting cuz this shit is tiring and im sick of it and if u relate pls let me know i want to know im not alone in this", "label": "anxiety"}

{"text": "my girlfriend is the survivor of a narc mom and her past two relationships were abusive the most recent to her soon to be exhusband involved severe mental physical and sexual abuse as well as drug use we had a relationship that ended about 7 years ago in which we deeply loved each other and were as closed to meant to be together as you can be i was close with her oldest daughter at the time and we both agree we have always been extremely important to each other even without seeing each other for 7 years she contacted me on nov 1st from a laundromat where she and her 3 kids were hiding from her husband neither of us knew what we were getting into it started purely supportive i wasnt there to save her and she didnt want it she did all the hard work with just my support but after about a month and a half she was going to therapy and feeling much better we both had the feelings come back and because of the only living situation she had being a very bad one she moved in i realize now how bad this was for her but she kept working and healing and by the beggining of march we were in a very healthy realtionship both of us feeling independent and both very open with our communication it was an amazing relationship and it was very real at that time she started seeing an edmr therapist and uncovered issues from her moms codependency which led her to start feeling bad that she didnt do things on her own for her and her kids she started distancing herself mainly just with touching at first then sex but all other areas stayed the same we talked about it and she was convinced that she just needed to feel more productive in the relationship and therapy would help we still didnt know how bad ptsd is a coupke weeks after she got a restraining order on her husband and wanted to play darts with her friends which she wasnt able to do since she left and is a big part of her life the first night went great and we agreed that she would go a couple more times just to make sure that her ex wouldnt cause problems the second night she stopped texting me and never came home we talked about it and she said she just got real drunk and stayed at one of her friends houses the next time a few days later no drinking no issues that was the last night i saw her as the person she really is for the next few weeks she went out 3 or 4 nights a week stopped texting me at around 10 and didnt come home she said she just wanted to enjoy not being controlled and i panicked because i didnt want to push her away she is a very deep loving person and very empathetic and shows her feelings but this whole time there was no remorse it seemed as if she didnt recognize any impact it was havjng on me and the kids there was no emotion no regret i couldnt talk to her at all it was like everything she ever felt for me was completely erased from her mind about a week and a half ago she didnt make it home to take the kids to school so i had to take her the first thing she said was im at my moms apparently im drinking too much and i dont want to talk about it because it makes me feel like shit that day i got her to tell me that she couldnt figure out any of her feelings for anythjng and all she could think about was getting her own place and being independant a few days later she told me that there was a guy she liked and then after her therapy appointment she said we needed to take a step back and not be dating so she could find herself i didnt see her for a couple days and then on mothers day we spent the whole day together talking about plans we had made and doing stuff to the house and together with the kids no emotional or intamate things though but it was like she got turned back on that was six days ago and its like she has seperated her life into two in a relationship without the relationship with me is the best i can describe it and once 9 or 10 comes she shuts it off goes out or sleeps on the couch i have never pushed her to do anything she didnt want to do never accused her or reacted to what i thought might be happening i know there were mistakes made but we were genuinely happy and she was doing really well she just started a better job and my biggest concern is that she doesnt ruin what she has going but i cant help but want to save what we had together i just want to know if any of this sounds familiar and if so how can i help her and help us", "label": "ptsd"}

{"text": "hello friends i just discovered this sub today and i feel like it might help if i told a bit of my story to those of you who are dealing with rage and anger i was diagnosed with ptsd with hyper vigilance around 2 years ago i was honestly very surprised because i just thought that what i went through on a daily basis was common and that all the weird stuff i do was just myself being my weird self after being in therapy for these last two years my eyes have been opened to how absolutely serious this condition is for myself and others so again i wanted to share my story and hopefully it helps in some way my bio dad was a drug dealer big time stuff moving trucks worth and spent time in prison so sad to say he wasnt kind to my brother and i we were regularly beaten until my mother divorced him when i was 4 so i dont remember much after that mom wasnt much better due to her alcoholism so the abuse continued when i was 12 i woke up angry one day and it didnt go away until i was 25 or 26 it felt like a had a hot metal rod in my chest and everything pissed me off i ate my breakfast angry laughed with my few friends at school while angry and blushed my teeth at night while angry anyone who knew me all said the same thing thats im nice quite and kind of weird and when i released my anger i would scare the crap out of people because i would turn into a rage monster and just attack do not pass go and collect 200 if i snapped then get the fuck out of my way the reason i was weird to most people was because of my hyper vigilance i noticed everything and would take note of every detail i couldnt control it and if someone asked me hey did you see that guy over there my response would be sure you mean the guy with the white shirt jean shorts with the black vans and the green shark watch i just thought when you walked into a room you took note of all the exits and would look around for potential weapons to be able to defend myself when i got into my twenties things got hard the anger and rage got a lot worse and i would trigger around 2 to 6 times a day my ptsd is based off sound for two reasons 1 i was born around 50 deaf so when i was 6 months old they put tubes in my eyes that widened my ear canals and later when i took a hearing test for a job they told me i hear 12 to 15 better than the average person basically my ears pick up a few octaves lower and loud sounds literally hurt my ears 2 my mother was very verbally abusive so when she got mad she would scream until her throat was hoarse im order to keep myself sane and not hurt anyone i constructed a castle in my mind that both kept me inside and the dangerous people outside this worked great for years but it was an unknowingly temporary fix and i can say the last two years of therapy has helped tremendously im more exposed now and i tend to trigger easier than i did before when i had my castle but i cry a lot more now which is extremely helpful im a grown ass man and i cry a lot now and thats ok i still struggle regularly and am not out of the woods but its ok im only human i am more selfish with my time now and i dont put myself in situations that might trigger me if i do then i deal with the triggered event will smoke weed after to calm down and change my train of thought this is also a temporary fix until i can get more control but its ok i hope my story helps and if anyone has any questions please reach out thanks", "label": "ptsd"}

depressive disorder mild ocd have disassociative episodes not did but have not been medicated for it even on the best days when i am properly medicated and have rainbows shooting out of my back side some people seem to not understand the difference between being assertive and insane hyper aggression sent someone a message earlier that said i could say i love dr pepper and the other person responds like why would you even think about killing my puppy you legit fing psychopath fucking c ill fing go back in time and kill your mother before you are ever born and they agreed that person has seen it with people close to me over the years and also people i interact with only very rarely some people respond to things they think i mean and then get extremely upset that i am not listening when i explain what i really meant accuse me of not listening to what they are saying and then later after i have actively listened and responded to what theyve said when i think its finally my turn to communicate how i feel i get told that i wont just leave them alone and am bothering them some have even said i was beating them down with my words because i repeated what i actually said a handful of times its not like i was harassing them or swearingcalling them namesbeing abusive just firmly stating that what they apparently heard was not what was actually said before i had communicated that i dont feel heard and dont feel like i am able to discuss my stuff too then a few of them starting saying things like you shut me down and dont let me speak when sometimes they talk for 20m without me responding at all if i do not immediately respond then i am ignoring them if i respond to that that i am not ignoring them then i am attacking them ive been told its not so much what you are saying so much as how you say it which is fine and valid but someone today accused me of being really angry and then accused me of mansplaining to them im a woman btw when i tried to explain the difference between being irritated and being angry the responses they gave me were apparently because of how angry i was when i wasnt ever angry but simply irritated because i wasnt feeling like the other person was listening to what i was saying convos often go you are so angry i had to do x thing and then me saying but i am not angry at all and then being told i am not listening i work every day on my tone and think a lot about how the things i say could potentially be perceived i do my best to not unintentionally push anyones buttons or do anything to cause massive freak outs i bite my tongue constantly and even though the other people are hitting below the belt i do my best to not sink to that level its not that i dont think things on that level or even worse things but they dont come out of my mouth lol i also am constantly trying to figure out which things to let slide off my back and which things need to be talked about to further improve what me and whichever one of them it is decide is healthy or effective communication there is like a 5050 shot of someone loving me and thinking i am the greatest thing ever in the history of the world and them thinking i am legit satan and they hope terrible things happen to me and blame me for everything wrong thats ever happened and it really feels like a coin toss as to which way it will be however that decision is made i have no idea but it seems to be permanent or almost a lot of people ive interacted with seem to have black and white thinking and i do everything i can to be in the gray area those two things seem to be like oil and water i am at my wits friggin end trying to figure out how we can meet each other half way i can be a total jerk when i feel like someone is being unfair to someone i care about and i can be extremely self righteous and critical but the vast majority of that stuff doesnt leave my brain i vent and moan and point out peoples contradictions and lack of logical thinking etc i am no angel if pushed but truly messed up stuff that could be construed as abusive i do my best to just swallow down any of those things because some things cannot be unsaid i wont say something just to hurt someone knowing it isnt true just because it is one of their triggers i usually wont even say something i do know is true if it will hurt them i will call someone right the heck out about their do as i say not as i do things in regards to communication though i will often sacrifice my own happiness and well being if it would help someone else i care deeply for to me much happier when i hit my limit though after trying to talk to someone 3985794875934875 xs and being ignored i cut them off permanently and coolly and have no time to deal with their drama and at that point it has stopped being something important that i would like to work on and becomes drama with a capital d its not like i talk just once or even a dozen times about what my issues are i am not perfect and i certainly do not expect anyone else to be either but imo you should at least try to work on things if you want to be in each others lives i really wish i could figure this out my therapists over many years when i was still in america generally said that i was good with my boundaries and that i should just continue on enforcing them and just let people who wont respect them just fade away sounds great right but that cant always work some of the people involved now it would be very difficult to remove myself from the situation because of how they are connected to me in ways that are much more difficult to

different category now would have to muster the courage to see a doc again to find out professionally but for now i am managing rather well no hospital visits self harm aggression towards others whatsoever i dont like to talk about meds for myself but for context i am currently unmediated but i have experience with wellbutrin lithium and lamogritine curious what you guys have to say about your experiences with hunger appetite and overall nutrition in general i own my own business running a small organic farm that sells at a local farmers market food soil biology and stewardship are huge passions of mine my transition from a childhood of mcdonalds kraft macncheese ramen noodle and pop tarts into the last 3 years of fresh produce meals from scratch leafy greens in every meal and an addiction to fermented foods is part of what allowed me to make some serious forward bounds in my mental health self care i recognize that the stamina and motivation to make meals is greatly hindered by the conditions we face and not everyone has the time or wherewithal to have this kind of diet i cook very big im almost always eating alone portions and do a bit of faux meal prepping by way of having gobs of leftovers available all the time i have no appetite when im in the depression end for the most part when i know im in the pits i wager if ill be eating anything it wont be until late at night somewhere between 9pm2am which i dont necessarily hate but it does mean that i am quick to run out of physical energy when im working the field and weeding during the day im not sure if what i feel at that point is hunger but there is a certain emptiness to my core when ive eaten nothing for 24 hours the anxiety that comes in devastating waves during the depression period often makes me wish i could rip my stomach out and chuck it in the woods its a similar feeling to the fight or flight thing where you feel your gut sink in your body and your throat quivers it makes the thought of eating something so unbearable that id rather suck on a napkin and chew tree bark than actually ingest anything it hurts me deeply because i believe so strongly in what good food has done for me i believe in the ineffable power of food to lift spirits and heal yet i seem to despise the stuff perhaps out of a hate that i have for myself projected onto food it is not uncommon for me to go 2 days with no appetite and become unreasonably hungry at 10 pm on day three when im manic i struggle similarly the appetite loss i experience in mania is not based in pain or disgust like depression but in more of a disinterest or a neglect its similar to how one might feel on molly or aderall where youre not hungry not full the food sounds good but eating it seems so bizarre like so much work to go through for something that is not nearly as interesting as what you could be doing instead sometimes ill make a meal tasting it for flavor along the way so i know its good but when i sit down to consume it the feeling of chewing in my mouth just totally robs me of the drive to eat it its delicious its fresh its nutritious but i take one bite and the appetite is gone other times ill completely forget about food i honestly wont even think about it at all until i collapse in bed out of exhaustion and realize my stomach is churning and crunching like a hydraulic press my ex never understood when she would check in at 11pm with the have you eaten today and i say ah i forgot  like that was a completely foreign thought to her how can you forget that which we all crave every day and brings us life in mania i can also go 24 days with no significant meal but not as often as depression so i suppose im just curious what you guys experience in the world of food and maybe some strategies you have learned over the years now i understand that meds can make this phenomenon so incredibly nuanced and if you have a way that this relates to meds please feel free to share that as well i think what i go through is some accidental remixed version of intermittent fasting brought about not by choice but of anxiety induced appetite loss so i do huge meals super inconsistently im wondering if it is unhealthy of me to be doing so much physical work with this kind of eating schedule i do wish that it wasnt this way that i could eat normal like my friends i used to rely on cannabis to stimulate my hunger but i feel that i cant rely on that for my whole life im 61 and 135 lbs so i really dont have much that i can afford to lose lest i start risking injury or permanent harm in other ways im a bit of a wind sail and im always cold i feel like asking my body to work so much while not giving it the fuel it needs and being so small is just asking for a broken something or a torn ligament things along those lines", "label": "bipolar"}
